# Beagle

Beagle is a tool for exploring different combinations of variables with decreasing generational variance once a pick has
been made. In other words, it will let you make combinations at random of several variables, pick one, then make more
variations that will be more similar to the last choice each time.

This was inspired by Wii and Xbox avatar creators, in which you can fully customize your avatar, but the starting point
will be a small range of possibilities, then the choices will be refined until you feel comfortable fine-grain fixing
the details.
